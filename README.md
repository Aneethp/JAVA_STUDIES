Operator Precedence: Dertermines the evaluation order of operators in an expression based on their priority levels.
Associativity: Defines the orfer of operation for operators with the same preccedence, usuallu left-to-right or right-to-left.

#4.10 (6:41:48) Intro to Number System 📖
Decimal Number system:
: Decimal Number is base on a base-10 system that has ten digits: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.
: The decimal number system is said to be of basem, or radix, 10 because it uses 10 digits abd the coefficients are multiplied by powers of 10.
: This is the base that we often use in our day to day life.
: Example:(7,392)10, where 7392 is a shorthand notation for what should be  write
Binary Number System:
: The coefficient of the binary number system have only two possible values: 0 and 1
: Each coefficient aj is multiplied by a power of the radix, e.g, 2j, and the results are added to obtain the decimal equivalent of the number.  

#4.11 (6:51:48) Intro to Bitwise Operators 👨‍💻
  1. AND Operator(&): performs on two integers. Each bit of the output is 1 if the corresponding bits of both operands are 1, otherwise 0.
  2. OR operatprs(|): Performs on both integers. Each bit of the output is 0 if the corresponding bits of both operands are 0, otherwise 1.
  3. XOR operator(^): performs on two integers.Each bit of the output is 1 if the corresponding bits of the operands are different.
  4. NOT operator(~): Performs a bitwise complement. it inverts the bits of its operand(0 becomes 1, and 1 becomes 0).
  5. Left Shift Operator(<<): Shifts the left operand'S bits to the left by the number of positions specified by the right operand,filling the new rightmost bits with zeros.
  6. Right Shift Operator(>>): Shifts the left operand's bits to the right. If the left operand is positive, zeros are filled into the new leftmost bits; if negative, ones are filled in.

☕ Java Methods & Functions — Fun Cheat Sheet 🎯
1️⃣ What is a Method?
A method = a block of code that performs a specific task.
Think of it like a vending machine: you call it, give it what it needs, and it gives you something back 🍫.

2️⃣ Basic Syntax
java
Copy
Edit
returnType methodName(parameters) {
    // code to execute
    return value; // optional if returnType is void
}
Example:

java
Copy
Edit
int addNumbers(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
3️⃣ Types of Methods
Built-in methods → Already in Java (e.g., Math.sqrt(), System.out.println()).

User-defined methods → You create them 💡.

4️⃣ Method Parameters
Parameters are like ingredients you give the method 🥣.

Example:

java
Copy
Edit
void greetUser(String name) {
    System.out.println("Hello, " + name + "!");
}
5️⃣ Return Type
void → returns nothing 🙅‍♀️

int, String, boolean, etc. → returns a value ✅
Example:

java
Copy
Edit
String getGreeting() {
    return "Good Morning!";
}
6️⃣ Method Overloading
Multiple methods with the same name but different parameters 🌀.

java
Copy
Edit
int add(int a, int b) { return a + b; }
double add(double a, double b) { return a + b; }
7️⃣ Static vs Instance Methods
Static method → Belongs to the class, call without creating an object
ClassName.methodName();

Instance method → Needs an object to call
objectName.methodName();

8️⃣ Why Use Methods?
✅ Avoid repeating code
✅ Make code cleaner & easier to understand
✅ Reuse logic anytime
