#4.9 (6:38:40) Operator Precedence 

Operator Precedence: Dertermines the evaluation order of operators in an expression based on their priority levels.
Associativity: Defines the orfer of operation for operators with the same preccedence, usuallu left-to-right or right-to-left.

#4.10 (6:41:48) Intro to Number System 📖
Decimal Number system:
: Decimal Number is base on a base-10 system that has ten digits: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.
: The decimal number system is said to be of basem, or radix, 10 because it uses 10 digits abd the coefficients are multiplied by powers of 10.
: This is the base that we often use in our day to day life.
: Example:(7,392)10, where 7392 is a shorthand notation for what should be  write
Binary Number System:
: The coefficient of the binary number system have only two possible values: 0 and 1
: Each coefficient aj is multiplied by a power of the radix, e.g, 2j, and the results are added to obtain the decimal equivalent of the number.  

#4.11 (6:51:48) Intro to Bitwise Operators 👨‍💻
  1. AND Operator(&): performs on two integers. Each bit of the output is 1 if the corresponding bits of both operands are 1, otherwise 0.
  2. OR operatprs(|): Performs on both integers. Each bit of the output is 0 if the corresponding bits of both operands are 0, otherwise 1.
  3. XOR operator(^): performs on two integers.Each bit of the output is 1 if the corresponding bits of the operands are different.
  4. NOT operator(~): Performs a bitwise complement. it inverts the bits of its operand(0 becomes 1, and 1 becomes 0).
  5. Left Shift Operator(<<): Shifts the left operand'S bits to the left by the number of positions specified by the right operand,filling the new rightmost bits with zeros.
  6. Right Shift Operator(>>): Shifts the left operand's bits to the right. If the left operand is positive, zeros are filled into the new leftmost bits; if negative, ones are filled in.
