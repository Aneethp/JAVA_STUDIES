# JAVA_STUDIES

****1. Introduction****
**01. Introduction:**
Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language that was first released by Sun Microsystems in 1995 (now owned by Oracle).


**02. Why you must learn Java**
Stable and Future-Proof:
Java has been around since 1995 and is still evolving.
Many critical systems depend on Java — they won’t disappear anytime soon.
 Good for Career Switching:
If you want to become a backend developer, mobile developer (Android), or cloud engineer, Java is a strong choice.
 Widely Used in the Real World:
Java is everywhere: Android apps, banking systems, e-commerce platforms, enterprise software, cloud computing, IoT.Big companies like Google, Amazon, Netflix, and banks still heavily use Java.


**03. What is the programming language**
A programming language is a set of instructions and rules that you can use to tell a computer what to do.
Think of it like this:
You speak English or Japanese to communicate with people.
You use a programming language to communicate with a computer.

💡 Simple analogy:
If a computer is like a robot, then a programming language is the recipe book that tells the robot exactly what steps to follow.


**04.What is an algorithm**
An algorithm is a step-by-step set of instructions for solving a problem or performing a task.
It’s like a recipe in cooking — it tells you exactly what to do, in what order, to get the desired result.
Key points:
> Purpose – To solve a problem efficiently.
> Characteristics –
     Clear: Each step is unambiguous.
     Finite: Has a definite beginning and end.
     Effective: Solves the problem within a reasonable time.
> Examples in daily life –
     Following steps to make tea.
     Sorting names in alphabetical order.
     Navigating from home to work using Google Maps.

Example in programming (finding the largest number in a list):
> Start.
> Assume the first number is the largest.
> Compare it with the next number.
> If the next number is larger, make it the new largest.
> Repeat until all numbers are checked.
> Output the largest number.
> Stop.

💡 In short:
Programming language = the tool to tell a computer what to do.
Algorithm = the plan or strategy for how to do it.


**04. What is syntax**
Syntax in programming is the set of rules that define how you must write code so that the computer can understand it.
It’s like grammar in a human language — if you break grammar rules, people may not understand you; if you break syntax rules, the computer will throw an error.

Key points:
> Purpose – Ensures the code is structured correctly so it can be compiled or interpreted.
> Examples in Java syntax –
    Statements must end with a semicolon (;).
    Curly braces { } define the start and end of a block.
    Keywords (like class, public, if) must be lowercase.


**05. Magic of bytecode**
1. What is Bytecode?
Bytecode is a special, intermediate code generated by the Java Compiler (javac) when you compile your .java file.
It’s not plain text (Java source code) and not pure machine code — it’s a set of instructions for the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
Bytecode files have the extension .class.

2. Why is Bytecode Magical?
> Platform Independent:
 You write Java code once → compile it into bytecode → that bytecode can run on any device with a JVM (Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, etc.).
> Portable:
 No need to rewrite code for different systems — the JVM adapts it to the machine’s CPU and OS.
> Secure & Managed:
 JVM checks bytecode for security and memory safety before running it.
> Optimized Execution:
 JVM uses Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation to turn bytecode into native machine code at runtime, making it fast.


3. Java Program Execution Flow
Write Java source code (.java).
Compile with javac → creates bytecode (.class).
Run the bytecode using the JVM → JVM translates it to machine code for your OS.


**06. Object Oriented Programming**
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a way of designing and writing programs by organizing code into objects that represent real-world things or concepts.
Java is a fully object-oriented language (except for its primitive data types), which means OOP is at its core.
1. Key Idea:
Instead of writing code as one long list of instructions, you break it into objects that have:
 >Attributes (data, called fields or variables)
 >Behaviors (functions, called methods)
Example:
Object: Car
      -Attributes: color, model, speed
      -Behaviors: start(), stop(), accelerate()

2. Main Principles of OOP
a) Encapsulation
> Keeping data (variables) and methods (functions) together inside one unit (class).
> Restricting access to some parts of the object using access modifiers (private, public).
> Example: You can’t directly change a car’s engine from outside — you use methods like startEngine().

b) Inheritance
> One class can inherit the properties and methods of another class.
> Helps in code reuse.
> Example:
      Vehicle (parent class)
      Car and Bike (child classes that inherit from Vehicle)

c) Polymorphism
> One name, many forms — a method can behave differently depending on the object calling it.
> Example:
      draw() method could draw a circle, rectangle, or triangle depending on the shape object.

d) Abstraction
> Hiding unnecessary details and showing only the important features.
> Example: You drive a car without knowing the exact internal engine mechanics — you just use accelerate() and brake().

3. Benefits of OOP
> Reusability (use existing code for new programs)
> Maintainability (easy to update or fix)
> Scalability (easy to add new features)
> Better organization of code


** 07. Programming Challenge 1-3**
1. Create a class to output "good morning" and check the output.
2. Create a new project and output "Hello there" on the console.
3. Show the following pattern.
   *          * * * *           *
   * *        * * *           * *
   * * *      * *           * * *

#4.10 (6:41:48) Intro to Number System 📖
Decimal Number system:
: Decimal Number is base on a base-10 system that has ten digits: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.
: The decimal number system is said to be of basem, or radix, 10 because it uses 10 digits abd the coefficients are multiplied by powers of 10.
: This is the base that we often use in our day to day life.
: Example:(7,392)10, where 7392 is a shorthand notation for what should be  write
Binary Number System:
: The coefficient of the binary number system have only two possible values: 0 and 1
: Each coefficient aj is multiplied by a power of the radix, e.g, 2j, and the results are added to obtain the decimal equivalent of the number.  

#4.11 (6:51:48) Intro to Bitwise Operators 👨‍💻
  1. AND Operator(&): performs on two integers. Each bit of the output is 1 if the corresponding bits of both operands are 1, otherwise 0.
  2. OR operatprs(|): Performs on both integers. Each bit of the output is 0 if the corresponding bits of both operands are 0, otherwise 1.
  3. XOR operator(^): performs on two integers.Each bit of the output is 1 if the corresponding bits of the operands are different.
  4. NOT operator(~): Performs a bitwise complement. it inverts the bits of its operand(0 becomes 1, and 1 becomes 0).
  5. Left Shift Operator(<<): Shifts the left operand'S bits to the left by the number of positions specified by the right operand,filling the new rightmost bits with zeros.
  6. Right Shift Operator(>>): Shifts the left operand's bits to the right. If the left operand is positive, zeros are filled into the new leftmost bits; if negative, ones are filled in.

☕ Java Methods & Functions — Fun Cheat Sheet 🎯
1️⃣ What is a Method?
A method = a block of code that performs a specific task.
Think of it like a vending machine: you call it, give it what it needs, and it gives you something back 🍫.

2️⃣ Basic Syntax
java
Copy
Edit
returnType methodName(parameters) {
    // code to execute
    return value; // optional if returnType is void
}
Example:

java
Copy
Edit
int addNumbers(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
3️⃣ Types of Methods
Built-in methods → Already in Java (e.g., Math.sqrt(), System.out.println()).

User-defined methods → You create them 💡.

4️⃣ Method Parameters
Parameters are like ingredients you give the method 🥣.

Example:

java
Copy
Edit
void greetUser(String name) {
    System.out.println("Hello, " + name + "!");
}
5️⃣ Return Type
void → returns nothing 🙅‍♀️

int, String, boolean, etc. → returns a value ✅
Example:

java
Copy
Edit
String getGreeting() {
    return "Good Morning!";
}
6️⃣ Method Overloading
Multiple methods with the same name but different parameters 🌀.

java
Copy
Edit
int add(int a, int b) { return a + b; }
double add(double a, double b) { return a + b; }
7️⃣ Static vs Instance Methods
Static method → Belongs to the class, call without creating an object
ClassName.methodName();

Instance method → Needs an object to call
objectName.methodName();

8️⃣ Why Use Methods?
✅ Avoid repeating code
✅ Make code cleaner & easier to understand
✅ Reuse logic anytime
